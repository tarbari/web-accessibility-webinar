    -   Disabilities are not always permanent
    -   Disabilities can also be Temporary or Situational
        -   Hearing could be situationally impaired when you are in a loud enviroment
        -   Touch could be temporarily impaired if you have a broken hand
        -   Blindness would be (usually) an example of a permanent disability
-   Making accessible digital services benefits everyone

    -   Elevators

-   WCAG 2.1 is the latest version
-   Examples of criteria
    -   1.1.1 Non-text content
        -   All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose
    -   1.4.1 Use of color
        -   Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element
